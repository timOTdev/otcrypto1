          "Blockchain is a revolutionary technology in my belief. It has created disruption within the traditional finance arena (CeFi) and made us rethink fiat currency. We're going into how the rise of this technology elevated so quickly due to reasons such as inflation, manipulation, and other events. Clearly, the finance space is ripe for change as the system has gate-kept unprivileged people for so long and the government clearly has no intention of stopping the printing press for the dollar. Let's take a look at the reasons why I believe more in DeFi over CeFi.",

    "I only got better at finance when I decided to work on it. I didn't get it from my family or from school. I wasn't blessed with meeting the right people or winning the lottery. I became more competent because I chose to build a relationship and respect for money. I put in a tremendous amount of time trying destruct to the financial system so I can achieve financial independence. I created this brand so that I can help motivate and help others understand their financial landscape. The brand keeps me accountable to keep learning and sharing.",
    "Finances seems like a huge beast at first but if you break it down and learn piece by piece, the big picture will come together, I promise. There's no one perfect strategy, the perfect strategy is one that works for you and your situation. Your money is your responsibility and no one knows how to handle it better than you. There's always risk and reward in every action, study well. However, you can rest assure that we are experiencing a major disruption in the financial sector. I'm happy that power is returning back to the people where it belongs. With that, let's push forward towards one of the brightest futures I've seen in a long time.",
