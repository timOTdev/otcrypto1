We're going into how the rise of this technology elevated so quickly due to reasons such as inflation, manipulation, and other events. Clearly, the finance space is ripe for change as the system has gate-kept unprivileged people for so long and the government clearly has no intention of stopping the printing press for the dollar. Let's take a look at the reasons why I believe more in DeFi over CeFi.",

There's always risk and reward in every action, study well. However, you can rest assure that we are experiencing a major disruption in the financial sector.
